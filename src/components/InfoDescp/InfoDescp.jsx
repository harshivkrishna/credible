            <p>When you consider us as your wedding photographer, you're inviting more than just  a team of  people with cameras. You're hiring us for our perspective; not just our experience of shooting over 400 weddings, but our journey as humans who have laughed with people, wept over lost loved ones  and who have strived to lead a life closely connected to love.</p>
            <p>It's these experiences that have given us a perspective that allows us to be acutely aware of the importance of a wedding day and the once-in-a-lifetime moments, toasts, hugs, and embraces from family members you may never see again.</p>
            <p>And really…it&apos;s hard to grasp the sacredness of your wedding day as a bride and groom. But we promise you, 10 years into your marriage you’ll know. And you’ll either have hired a photographer who was aware of it too…or you&apos;ll be wishing for images never made.</p>
