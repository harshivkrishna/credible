            <p>You saw stories that you connected with. Honest photos that made you feel something…and while you've seen other photographer's work, this time you felt something real. You don't want traditional or posey…you want relaxed and intentional..or as we like to call it 'honest and unfussy'.
            </p>
            <p>You think having a team of professional photographers shoot your wedding is pretty damn awesome and if every guest at your wedding thought you were friends with your photographers that would be even awesome-er. Because you'll be relaxed in front of the camera knowing that everything is being captured.</p>

        <div className="exp-text-right-container">
            <p>Not just how pretty the flowers are, but the raw moments when you saw your parents cry for the first time in years.</p>
            <p>You care about having timeless, artistic images that capture your day…and if it rains..it rains…and if the electricity goes out then you'll build a fire and light some candles.</p>
            <p>We think it's great that you care... because we want you to! We don't want you to book us because we're local or offered the best package. We simply want you to have the best experience ever, and we offer it.</p>
