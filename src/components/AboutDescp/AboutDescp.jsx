                <p>We have identified photography as an art to paint emotions of people. We capture the real life spirit of atmosphere surrounding the wedding ceremonies.</p>
                <br />
                <p>For wedding we cover a creative and personal story that's completely yours, and it's our job to capture that story in a beautiful and innovative way. We aim to constantly develop new and artistic ways of presenting portraiture. When we think about wedding ceremonies we think about people, happiness, joy, laughter, emotions, dance, colours, rituals, traditions, vibrance and words just seem to fall short.</p>
                <br />
                <p>To bring all these together in images that tell a story that gives you an essence of not only what your wedding looked like, but also of how it felt is the true job of a photographer.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The photographs have to speak to you, touch your heart and inspire the happiness that was created when two hearts committed, when loved ones blessed, when friends and family cheered and rejoiced the wonderful union. Photography for us is not just looking, it's feeling.</p>
